        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
            OCR-Tess4j-Rest is mavenized/graddle'ed with Rest API version of Tess4j.
            Tess4J is a JNA wrapper for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract
            OCR API</a>; it provides character recognition support for common image formats, and multi-page images. 
            The library has been developed and tested on Windows and Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tess4J is released and distributed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">
            Apache License, v2.0</a>. Its official homepage is at <a href="http://tess4j.sourceforge.net/">
            http://tess4j.sourceforge.net</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://java.oracle.com/">Java Runtime Environment 6.0</a> 32-bit, 
            <a href="http://jna.java.net/">JNA</a>, and
            <a href="http://jai-imageio.java.net/">JAI-ImageIO</a> are required. 
        </p>
    
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            The Tesseract OCR DLL file, language data for English, and sample images are bundled
            with the library. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list">Language
            data packs</a> for Tesseract should be decompressed and placed into the <tt>tessdata</tt>
            folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Linux shared object library (<tt>libtesseract.so</tt>) equivalent to the DLL is available in Tesseract 3.02, which can be built from the 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/source/checkout" target="_blank">source</a> with the instructions given in
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/Compiling" target="_blank">
            Tesseract Wiki</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            PDF support is possible via <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/">GPL
            Ghostscript</a>. After installation of GS, ensure its shared library
            object (<tt>gsdll32.dll</tt>) is in the search path by setting the appropriate environment
            variable. On Windows, append the following to <tt>Path</tt> value (accessible through
            Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Advanced &gt; Environment Variables) for GS version 9.06:
        </p>
        
        <p>To unit test, at the command line, execute:</p>
       
        <p>
            Images to be OCRed should be scanned at resolution from at least 200 DPI (dot per
            inch) to 400 DPI in monochrome (black&amp;white) or grayscale. Scanning at higher
            resolutions will not necessarily result in better recognition accuracy. The actual
            success rates depend greatly on the quality of the scanned image. The typical settings
            for scanning are 300 DPI and 1 bpp (bit per pixel) black&amp;white or 8 bpp grayscale
            uncompressed TIFF or PNG format. PNG is usually smaller in size than other image
            formats and still keeps high quality due to its employing lossless data compression
            algorithms; TIFF has the advantage of the ability to contain multiple images (pages)
            in a file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several built-in functions are also provided for merging several images or PDF files
            into a single one for convenient OCR operations, or for splitting a PDF file into
            smaller ones if it is too large, which can cause out-of-memory exceptions.
        </p>

        <h3>CODE EXAMPLES</h3>
        
        <p>
            The following code example shows common usage of the library. Make sure <tt>libtesseract302.dll</tt>
            and <tt>tessdata</tt> folder are in the same directory and the <tt>.jar</tt> files
            are in the classpath.
        </p>

        try {
            String result = instance.doOCR(imageFile);
            System.out.println(result);
